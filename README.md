### Transformation

You can use controllers to change material parameters in real time  
- choose **tone color** to give a hue to the material
- use **roughness** to adjust the roughness of the material
- **fresnel power** value affects Fresnel reflection
- change the **fog power** value to affect the transparency of the fog inside the material
- the value of **color power** affects the saturation of the hue

### Post-production

At the post-production stage  was used FXAAShader that performs antialiasing

### Thanks

Thanks go out to my mentor and teacher @lllarp.
